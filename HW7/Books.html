<tr> <td> 1 </td> <td> The Anti-Social Family </td> <td> Michele Barrett </td> <td> Mary McIntosh </td> <td> 1982 </td> <td> 9781781687598 </td> <td> Sensitive but uncompromising socialist-feminist critique of the nuclear family </td> <td> An extremely brave, and with the benefit of hindsight, what must appear to be a very daring critique of the family. </td>

<tr> <td> 2 </td> <td> Fortunes of Feminism </td> <td> Nancy Fraser </td> <td> NA </td> <td> 2013 </td> <td> 9781844679843 </td> <td> Charts the history of women's liberation and calls for a revitalized feminism.  </td> <td> Nancy Fraser is among the very few thinkers in the tradition of critical theory who are capable of redeeming its legacy in the twenty-first century. </td>

<tr> <td> 3 </td> <td> The Erotic Margin </td> <td> Irvin C. Schick </td> <td> NA </td> <td> 2012 </td> <td> 9781781680650 </td> <td> Reviewing the large, disparate, and often contradictory western discourse on gender and sexuality of the Other </td> <td> Schick explores the netherworld of ethnopornographic sources, then returns to high ground with a theory of alterist discourse that opens new horizons for eveyone interested in representations of the Other. I know of no other work that theorizes the exoticization and eroticization of the Other with such rigor or such far-reaching implications. </td>
