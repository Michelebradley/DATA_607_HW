		<title> The Erotic Margin </title>
		<author> Irvin C. Schick </author>
		<year> 2012 </year>
		<isbn> 9781781680650 </isbn>
		<description> Reviewing the large, disparate, and often contradictory western discourse on gender and sexuality of the Other </description>
		<review> “Schick explores the netherworld of ethnopornographic sources, then returns to high ground with a theory of alterist discourse that opens new horizons for eveyone interested in representations of the Other. I know of no other work that theorizes the exoticization and eroticization of the Other with such rigor or such far-reaching implications.” </review>
